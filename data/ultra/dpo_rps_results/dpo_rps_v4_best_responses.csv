Input: Integrins are membrane receptors which mediate cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion. Integrin alpha IIb beta 3 (glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) acts as a fibrinogen receptor of platelets and mediates platelet aggregation. Platelet activation is required for alpha IIb beta 3 to shift from noncompetent to competent for binding soluble fibrinogen. The steps involved in this transition are poorly understood. We have studied a variant of Glanzmann thrombasthenia, a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by absence of platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding. The patient's platelets did not bind fibrinogen after platelet activation by ADP or thrombin, though his platelets contained alpha IIb beta 3. However, isolated alpha IIb beta 3 was able to bind to an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser affinity column, and binding of soluble fibrinogen to the patient's platelets could be triggered by modulators of alpha IIb beta 3 conformation such as the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide and alpha-chymotrypsin. These data suggested that a functional Arg-Gly-Asp binding site was present within alpha IIb beta 3 and that the patient's defect was not secondary to a blockade of alpha IIb beta 3 in a noncompetent conformational state. This was evocative of a defect in the coupling between platelet activation and alpha IIb beta 3 up-regulation. We therefore sequenced the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on platelet RNA, and found a T-->C mutation at nucleotide 2259, corresponding to a Ser-752-->Pro substitution. This mutation is likely to be responsible for the uncoupling of alpha IIb beta 3 from cellular activation because (i) it is not a polymorphism, (ii) it is the only mutation in the entire alpha IIb beta 3 sequence, and (iii) genetic analysis of the family showed that absence of the Pro-752 beta 3 allele was associated with the normal phenotype. Our data thus identify the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain of beta 3 as an intrinsic element in the coupling between alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet activation.

3,"Evaluate the extent to which web usability is affected by various design styles, including color scheme, typography, layout, and navigation. Provide specific examples and empirical evidence to support your analysis.","(0.9397, 0.3420)",19.999328942043046,1,"Web usability is significantly affected by various design styles, including color scheme, typography, layout, and navigation. These elements of web design play a crucial role in making a website visually appealing, easy to use, and engaging to the users. In this analysis, we will evaluate the extent to which these design styles impact web usability and provide specific examples and empirical evidence to support our analysis.

Color Scheme:

Color is one of the most important design elements that can affect web usability. A well-designed color scheme can make a website more visually appealing, engaging, and easier to navigate. On the other hand, a poorly chosen color scheme can make a website look unprofessional, confusing, and unpleasant to the users.

For instance, a study conducted by the University of Missouri found that a website with a blue color scheme had higher user engagement and retention rates than a website with a red color scheme. The study also found that blue is associated with trust, security, and reliability, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Similarly, a study by the American Institute of Architects found that a website with a green color scheme had a higher conversion rate than a website with a red color scheme. The study also found that green is associated with health, nature, and environmental sustainability, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Typography:

Typography refers to the design and arrangement of text on a website. A well-designed typography can make a website more readable, legible, and enjoyable to the users. On the other hand, a poorly designed typography can make a website look unprofessional, confusing, and unpleasant to the users.

For instance, a study conducted by the University of Basel found that a website with a serif font had higher user engagement and readability rates than a website with a sans-serif font. The study also found that serif fonts are associated with tradition, elegance, and sophistication, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Similarly, a study by the University of California found that a website with a bold font had higher user engagement and readability rates than a website with a thin font. The study also found that bold fonts are associated with authority, power, and confidence, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Layout:

Layout refers to the arrangement of visual elements on a website. A well-designed layout can make a website more organized, intuitive, and easy to navigate. On the other hand, a poorly designed layout can make a website look cluttered, confusing, and unpleasant to the users.

For instance, a study conducted by Stanford University found that a website with a clean layout had higher user engagement and satisfaction rates than a website with a cluttered layout. The study also found that clean layouts are associated with simplicity, clarity, and efficiency, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Similarly, a study by the University of Gothenburg found that a website with a grid-based layout had higher user engagement and satisfaction rates than a website with a free-form layout. The study also found that grid-based layouts are associated with structure, consistency, and coherence, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Navigation:

Navigation refers to the process of finding and accessing information on a website. A well-designed navigation can make a website more intuitive, user-friendly, and enjoyable to the users. On the other hand, a poorly designed navigation can make a website look confusing, frustrating, and unpleasant to the users.

For instance, a study conducted by the University of Sydney found that a website with a vertical navigation had higher user engagement and satisfaction rates than a website with a horizontal navigation. The study also found that vertical navigation is associated with simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Similarly, a study by the University of Michigan found that a website with a breadcrumb navigation had higher user engagement and satisfaction rates than a website with a dropdown navigation. The study also found that breadcrumb navigation is associated with transparency, clarity, and organization, which are important factors for building user trust and loyalty.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, web usability is significantly affected by various design styles, including color scheme, typography, layout, and navigation. A well-designed website with a coherent color scheme, legible typography, intuitive layout, and user-friendly navigation can make a website more visually appealing, engaging, and enjoyable to the users. On the other hand, a poorly designed website with a confusing color scheme, unreadable typography, cluttered layout, and frustrating navigation can make a website look unprofessional, confusing, and unpleasant to the users. Therefore, it is essential for web designers to consider these design elements when creating a website to maximize user experience and engagement.",82.86763000488281,65.56315612792969,0.9396966265197998,0.34200913746171724,100.29363083986046,True,"[100.29363083986046, 96.79317168784625, 96.68672235032284]"

Example input: Property tax -- Property tax or 'house tax' is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is and imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Vacant land is generally exempt. Central government properties are exempt. Instead a 'service charge' is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.

For me, these two aspects of my life are intertwined in ways that are both intricate and deeply personal. I believe that my experiences with mental health have had a profound impact on my sexuality, and that my understanding of my sexual identity has, in turn, influenced my mental well-being.

When I was younger, I struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression. These feelings were exacerbated by stressors in my life, but they also made it difficult for me to form healthy relationships with others, including in the area of sexuality. It was challenging for me to open up to others about my mental health struggles, let alone about my sexuality. I felt like there was a stigma attached to both topics, and that discussing them would make me vulnerable and open to judgment.

As I got older, I began to explore my sexuality more deeply. I realized that my identity was not as fixed as I had once thought, and that I was capable of experiencing a range of emotions and desires. However, my mental health struggles continued to impact my sexuality. I found that anxiety and depression could make it difficult for me to be present in the moment, to fully enjoy a sexual experience. I often felt like I was going through the motions, rather than truly engaging with my partner.

At the same time, my mental health struggles have also made it challenging for me to find support and resources related to both mental health and sexuality. There are few resources available that address both topics simultaneously, and I often feel like I have to choose between prioritizing one aspect of my life over the other. This has led to feelings of isolation and frustration, as I struggle to find a sense of balance and integration in my life.

Despite these challenges, I have found that there are ways to cope with the intersection of mental health and sexuality. For me, this has involved prioritizing self-care and self-acceptance, as well as seeking out supportive communities and resources. I have also learned to communicate more openly with my partners about my mental health struggles, rather than trying to hide them away. This has allowed me to form deeper connections with others, and has helped me to feel more comfortable and confident in my own skin.

In conclusion, the relationship between mental health and sexuality is complex and multifaceted. For me, these two aspects of my life are deeply intertwined, and have had a profound impact on one another.

10,Write an investigative report on the state of homelessness in America.,"(0.9063, 0.4226)",24.999328942043046,3,"Introduction

Homelessness is a pervasive issue affecting millions of people in the United States, with over half a million individuals experiencing homelessness on any given night. The issue is particularly prevalent in urban areas across the country, where the cost of living is often too high for low-income individuals and families to afford housing. This report will explore the current state of homelessness in America, the factors contributing to this crisis, and the potential solutions to address it.

Causes of Homelessness

There are several factors contributing to homelessness in America, including lack of affordable housing, poverty, mental health issues, and substance abuse. The cost of living in many cities has risen sharply in recent years, making it difficult for low-income individuals to afford housing. Poverty is also a significant factor, with many individuals experiencing homelessness as a result of job loss, low wages, or other financial difficulties. Mental health issues and substance abuse can also contribute to homelessness, as individuals struggling with these conditions may have difficulty finding stable housing or maintaining employment.

Homelessness by State

Homelessness is a problem that affects every state in the country, with some states experiencing higher levels of homelessness than others. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the states with the highest rates of homelessness in 2019 were California, Hawaii, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington. However, homelessness is also a significant problem in states such as New York, Florida, and Texas, among others.

Homelessness Among Veterans

Homelessness among veterans is a particularly urgent issue in America, with over 45,000 veterans experiencing homelessness on any given night. This is a tragic situation, given that many of these individuals have served our country and deserve better. Homelessness among veterans is often the result of a number of factors, including mental health issues, substance abuse, and poverty.

Homelessness Among Children

The issue of homelessness also affects children in America, with over 2.5 million children experiencing homelessness in 2019. Homelessness among children is often the result of family instability, poverty, and abuse. Children experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable, and can suffer from a range of physical and mental health issues as a result.

Potential Solutions

There are several potential solutions to address the issue of homelessness in America. One potential solution is to increase funding for affordable housing, which would provide more options for low-income individuals and families. Another potential solution is to provide more support for mental health and substance abuse treatment, which could help individuals struggling with these issues find stable housing and employment.

Conclusion

Homelessness is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects millions of people in America. The causes of homelessness are varied and include factors such as lack of affordable housing, poverty, mental health issues, and substance abuse. Homelessness affects every state in the country, with some states experiencing higher levels of homelessness than others. There are several potential solutions to address this crisis, including increasing funding for affordable housing and providing more support for mental health and substance abuse treatment. However, homelessness remains a pressing issue in America, and more needs to be done to address this crisis and provide stability and security for all Americans.",78.14942169189453,63.11127471923828,0.9063127367517618,0.4226076468800956,97.49912354984899,True,"[91.35244259791064, 95.24888572093789, 97.49912354984899]"

In this task, you are given the abstract of a research paper. Your task is to generate a summary of this abstract. Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.
Part 2. Example
Mixed precision training (MPT) is becoming a practical technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of training deep neural networks by leveraging the fast hardware support for IEEE half-precision floating point that is available in existing GPUs. MPT is typically used in combination with a technique called loss scaling, that works by scaling up the loss value up before the start of backpropagation in order to minimize the impact of numerical underflow on training. Unfortunately, existing methods make this loss scale value a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned per-model, and a single scale cannot be adapted to different layers at different training stages. We introduce a loss scaling-based training method called adaptive loss scaling that makes MPT easier and more practical to use, by removing the need to tune a model-specific loss scale hyperparameter. We achieve this by introducing layer-wise loss scale values which are automatically computed during training to deal with underflow more effectively than existing methods. We present experimental results on a variety of networks and tasks that show our approach can shorten the time to convergence and improve accuracy, compared with using the existing state-of-the-art MPT and single-precision floating point.
Answer: We devise adaptive loss scaling to improve mixed precision training that surpass the state-of-the-art results.
Explanation: The abstract focusses on designing an adaptive loss scaling method, hence the generated output is correct.
Part 3. Exercise
The fault diagnosis in a modern communication system is traditionally supposed to be difficult, or even impractical for a purely data-driven machine learning approach, for it is a humanmade system of intensive knowledge. A few labeled raw packet streams extracted from fault archive can hardly be sufficient to deduce the intricate logic of underlying protocols. In this paper, we supplement these limited samples with two inexhaustible data sources: the unlabeled records probed from a system in service, and the labeled data simulated in an emulation environment. To transfer their inherent knowledge to the target domain, we construct a directed information flow graph, whose nodes are neural network components consisting of two generators, three discriminators and one classifier, and whose every forward path represents a pair of adversarial optimization goals, in accord with the semi-supervised and transfer learning demands. The multi-headed network can be trained in an alternative approach, at each iteration of which we select one target to update the weights along the path upstream, and refresh the residual layer-wisely to all outputs downstream. The actual results show that it can achieve comparable accuracy on classifying Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) streams without deliberate expert features. The solution has relieved operation engineers from massive works of understanding and maintaining rules, and provided a quick solution independent of specific protocols.

15,help me design an end user api for 3d camera animation in typescript.,"(0.9659, 0.2588)",14.999328942043046,1,"To design an end-user API for 3D camera animation in TypeScript, follow these steps:

1. Define the camera class:
```
export class Camera {
  public position: Vector3;
  public rotation: Quaternion;
  public zoom: number;

  constructor(position: Vector3, rotation: Quaternion, zoom: number) {
    this.position = position;
    this.rotation = rotation;
    this.zoom = zoom;
  }
}
```
This class defines the properties of the camera, including its position, rotation, and zoom level.

2. Define the animation class:
```
export class Animation {
  public camera: Camera;
  public startPosition: Vector3;
  public startRotation: Quaternion;
  public startZoom: number;
  public endPosition: Vector3;
  public endRotation: Quaternion;
  public endZoom: number;
  public duration: number;

  constructor(camera: Camera, startPosition: Vector3, startRotation: Quaternion, startZoom: number, endPosition: Vector3, endRotation: Quaternion, endZoom: number, duration: number) {
    this.camera = camera;
    this.startPosition = startPosition;
    this.startRotation = startRotation;
    this.startZoom = startZoom;
    this.endPosition = endPosition;
    this.endRotation = endRotation;
    this.endZoom = endZoom;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
```
This class defines the animation, including its camera, start and end positions and rotations, start and end zoom levels, and duration.

3. Define the animation API:
```
export class AnimationAPI {
  public startAnimation(animation: Animation): void {
    this.camera.position = this.camera.position.add(animation.startPosition);
    this.camera.rotation = this.camera.rotation.multiply(animation.startRotation);
    this.camera.zoom = animation.startZoom;

    const positionDifference = animation.endPosition.subtract(animation.startPosition);
    const rotationDifference = animation.endRotation.multiply(this.camera.rotation.inverse());
    const zoomDifference = animation.endZoom - animation.startZoom;

    let position = this.camera.position;
    let rotation = this.camera.rotation;
    let zoom = this.camera.zoom;

    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      this.animate(position, rotation, zoom, positionDifference, rotationDifference, zoomDifference);
    });
  }

  private animate(position: Vector3, rotation: Quaternion, zoom: number, positionDifference: Vector3, rotationDifference: Quaternion, zoomDifference: number): void {
    position = position.add(positionDifference.multiply(Math.min(1, (AnimationAPI.currentTime - AnimationAPI.startTime) / AnimationAPI.duration)));
    rotation = rotation.multiply(rotationDifference.multiply(Math.min(1, (AnimationAPI.currentTime - AnimationAPI.startTime) / AnimationAPI.duration)));
    zoom = Math.min(1, (AnimationAPI.currentTime - AnimationAPI.startTime) / AnimationAPI.duration) * zoomDifference + animation.startZoom;

    this.camera.position = position;
    this.camera.rotation = rotation;
    this.camera.zoom = zoom;

    if (AnimationAPI.currentTime < AnimationAPI.duration) {
      requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        this.animate(position, rotation, zoom, positionDifference, rotationDifference, zoomDifference);
      });
    } else {
      AnimationAPI.currentTime = 0;
      this.camera.position = this.camera.position.add(animation.endPosition);
      this.camera.rotation = this.camera.rotation.multiply(animation.endRotation);
      this.camera.zoom = animation.endZoom;
    }
  }
}
```
This class defines the API for starting and animating an animation. It includes a `startAnimation` method that sets the camera's position, rotation, and zoom to their start values and starts the animation. The `animate` method updates the camera's position, rotation, and zoom based on the animation's start and end values and the current time. It also updates the animation's duration and current time.

4. Use the API:
```
const camera = new Camera(new Vector3(0, 0, 0), new Quaternion(), 1);
const startPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, -10);
const startRotation = new Quaternion(Math.PI / 2, 0, 0, 0);
const startZoom = 0.1;
const endPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
const endRotation = new Quaternion();
const endZoom = 1;
const duration = 2;

const animation = new Animation(camera, startPosition, startRotation, startZoom, endPosition, endRotation, endZoom, duration);

AnimationAPI.startTime = performance.now();
AnimationAPI.currentTime = 0;
AnimationAPI.startAnimation(animation);
```
This code creates a camera and an animation, defines its start and end values, and starts the animation using the `startAnimation` method.

In summary, to design an end-user API for 3D camera animation in TypeScript, define the camera and animation classes, define the animation API, and use the API to start and animate the camera.",81.18550872802734,63.9578857421875,0.9659288575556857,0.2588077319964918,94.97222104796691,True,"[94.97222104796691, 78.9161445126403, 52.71289357312709]"

In this code, we first create a list of `Transaction` objects, each containing the name of the coin, the date and time of the transaction, and the profit or loss earned. We then create a list of `Coin` objects, where each coin is represented by its name and a list of transactions. We calculate the average profit and average loss for each coin by iterating over its transactions and summing up the profits and losses, respectively. We then sort the list of coins by their average profit in descending order using a lambda function that compares the profitOrLoss of each transaction. We then iterate over the sorted list of coins and add each transaction to the appropriate coin object. We then calculate the average profit and average loss for each coin object. Finally, we find the top 3 coins with the highest average profit and the top 3 coins with the highest average loss and print their names and average profit/loss.",79.2638168334961,65.01851654052734,0.9396966265197998,0.34200913746171724,96.72086804458576,True,"[75.98459399592092, 52.39124532400433, 96.72086804458576]"

The novel is told from the perspectives of both Nick Dunne and Amy Dunne, and both narrators are unreliable in their own ways.

Nick Dunne is a narrator who is unreliable because he is not always truthful about his actions and intentions. He often lies or withholds information, and his motivations are not always clear. This makes it difficult for the readers to trust Nick as a narrator, and it creates a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty throughout the novel.

Amy Dunne is a narrator who is unreliable because her perspective is distorted by her own mental instability. She creates a fictional persona of herself called ""Amazing Amy,"" which is a highly stylized and exaggerated version of her real self. This creates a sense of irony and disconnection between the reader and the character, as the readers are constantly aware of the gap between the fictional Amy and the real Amy.

The use of an unreliable narrator adds complexity to the novel by creating a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty. The readers are forced to question the motives and intentions of the characters, and they are constantly forced to reevaluate their assumptions about the events of the novel. This creates a sense of tension and suspense, as the readers are never sure what to expect or who to trust.

Overall, the use of an unreliable narrator is a key element of the novel's structure, and it plays a significant role in shaping the readers' understanding of the story.

33,What is relation between static keyword in C and program compilation ? How static keyword affects programming compilation ?,"(0.9659, 0.2588)",14.999328942043046,2,"The static keyword in C is used to declare a variable, function or object that has a lifetime of the entire program and is not destroyed when the block of code in which it is declared ends. This means that static variables and functions are initialized once at program start-up and remain in memory for the duration of the program.

The use of static keywords in C can affect program compilation in several ways. Firstly, it can improve the performance of the program as static variables and functions are initialized only once, which reduces the number of times that the memory allocation and deallocation process is executed. This can result in a faster program execution.

Secondly, static variables and functions are useful for storing global data or creating reusable code. For example, if a program needs to store a large amount of data that should be accessible from multiple functions, static variables can be used to store this data. Similarly, static functions can be used to create reusable code that can be invoked from multiple parts of the program.

Finally, the use of static keywords in C can also affect the size of the program generated by the compiler. Since static variables and functions remain in memory for the duration of the program, they take up more space in the program's memory than non-static variables and functions, which are deallocated when the block of code in which they are declared ends.

In summary, the static keyword in C is a powerful tool that can be used to improve program performance, create reusable code, and reduce the amount of memory used by the program. However, care must be taken when using static variables and functions to ensure that they are initialized correctly and do not lead to memory leaks or other performance issues.",68.10797882080078,61.24066162109375,0.9659288575556857,0.2588077319964918,81.6370189129228,True,"[64.32115629121762, 81.6370189129228, 68.3654740385545]"

In this essay, we will analyze the potential challenges that might arise and evaluate the impact of chatbots on customer service employees.

One of the most significant risks of deploying chatbots is the impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. According to a study by Juniper Research, 85% of customer interactions will be handled without human interaction by 2022. However, customers still expect a human touch in their interactions with businesses. Chatbots often lack empathy and personalization, which can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction. A study by Forrester found that 60% of consumers are frustrated when they have to interact with a chatbot. As a result, businesses that rely solely on chatbots for customer service may experience a decrease in customer loyalty and satisfaction.

Another potential challenge is the impact on brand reputation. If a chatbot fails to provide accurate and helpful responses, it can damage the business's reputation. A study by Accenture found that 41% of customers would stop doing business with a company if they had a negative experience with a chatbot. This can lead to a loss of customers, as well as negative word-of-mouth.

Additionally, chatbots can raise concerns about data privacy and security breaches. Chatbots can gather and store customer data, including personal information such as names, addresses, and credit card information. If this data is breached, it can lead to significant damage to the business's reputation and financial loss. Furthermore, chatbots can be vulnerable to algorithmic biases, which can lead to unfair treatment of customers.

Chatbots can also lead to a lack of personalization, which can negatively impact customer service. Customers expect tailored solutions that are specific to their unique needs, and chatbots may not be able to provide this level of personalization. This can lead to dissatisfaction and a lack of loyalty.

Finally, chatbots can lead to a shift in the role of customer service employees. As businesses rely more on chatbots, employees may feel undervalued and replaced in the company's operations. This can lead to a lack of motivation and decreased job satisfaction, which can negatively impact customer service quality.

In conclusion, deploying chatbots as a primary means of providing customer service comes with several potential risks and long-term negative effects. Businesses must consider the impact on customer satisfaction, loyalty, brand reputation, and overall bottom-line. Additionally, they must evaluate the impact on customer service employees and ensure that they are not undervalued in the company's operations. If businesses are to deploy chatbots effectively, they must strike a balance between automation and human touch to ensure that customers receive the best possible service.",77.37788391113281,62.021339416503906,0.9063127367517618,0.4226076468800956,96.33925403871935,True,"[96.08312969770407, 96.33925403871935, 95.5345755507148]"

This method will then be implemented to preprocess the input sentences, and the trained model will be further trained on this enriched dataset to focus on the most culturally relevant words in each sentence.

By assigning importance scores to each word based on its historical significance as well, you can provide a more nuanced and accurate translation for the given sentence pair.

In addition, you can also explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically identify the cultural and historical context of each sentence. For example, you can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to extract key phrases, entities, and concepts from each sentence and cross-reference them with a database of historical and cultural events to determine their significance. This approach can help you to identify the most relevant cultural and historical context for each sentence and provide a more accurate translation.

Abstract: Needs to have a definition of ERP - can't assume the reader knows what this means.  Intro: Avoid 1 sentence paragraphs (page 1) The introduction is rather long - it seems to actually be two different sections: an introduction (1st four paragraphs) and 1+ page of background and hypothesis. Overall - at 1.5 pages the intro is rather long for a paper that is 4 pages total.  Methodology: I think there are a lot of assumptions in regards to what ERP are and how they work.  While the paper is a statistical study, it would have benefited with a context of an actual example.  The samples are from small to medium size companies (how many?) with 49 use case (how do these relate?).  Results: Discussion is too limited - it assumes that a reader is very familiar with the area, and that may not be the case.

Vanishing and exploding gradients makes the optimization of RNNs very challenging. The issue becomes worse on tasks with long term dependencies that requires longer RNNs. One of the suggested approaches to improve the optimization is to optimize in a way that the transfer matrix is almost orthogonal. This paper investigate the role of orthogonality on the optimization and learning which is very important. The writing is sound and clear and arguments are easy to follow. The suggested optimization method is very interesting. The main shortcoming of this paper is the experiments which I find very important and I hope authors can update the experiment section significantly. Below I mention some comments on the experiment section:  1- I think the experiments are not enough. At the very least, report the result on the adding problem and language modeling task on Penn Treebank.  2- I understand that the copying task becomes difficult with non-lineary. However, removing non-linearity makes the optimization very different and therefore, it is very hard to conclude anything from the results on the copying task.  3- I was not able to find the number of hidden units used for RNNs in different tasks.  4- Please report the running time of your method in the paper for different numbers of hidden units, compare it with the SGD and mention the NN package you have used.  5- The results on Table 1 and Table 2 might also suggest that the orthogonality is not really helpful since even without a margin, the numbers are very close compare to the case when you find the optimal margin. Am I right?  6- What do we learn from Figure 2? It is left without any discussion.

Taking into account the loss in the binarization step through a proximal Newton algorithm is a nice idea. This is at least one approach to bringing in the missing loss in the binarization step, which has recently gone from a two step process of train and binarize to a single step simultaneous train/compress. Performance on a few small tasks show the benefit. It would be nice to see some results on substantial networks and tasks which really need compression on embedded systems (a point made in the introduction). Is it necessary to discuss exploding/vanishing gradients when the RNN experiments are carried out by an LSTM, and handled by the cell error carousel? We see the desire to tie into proposition 2, but not clear that the degradation we see in the binary connect is related. Adam is used in the LSTM optimization, was gradient clipping really needed, or is the degradation of binary connect simply related to capacity? For proposition 3.1, theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.2 put the pointers to proofs in appendix.

47,"Problem: I can use this background: Earth is a restless planet. Heat in the Earth’s interior causes giant plates of crust to move around on the surface. The crashing and smashing of these plates leads to nearly all of the geological activity we see. Plate collisions bring us volcanoes and earthquakes, mountain ranges, and many resources. Seafloor forms as plates move apart. Some of Earth’s most beautiful landscapes come from plate tectonics. The Grand Tetons in Wyoming rose up as the Farallon Plate sunk beneath the North American Plate during the Laramide orogeny.  Now, I have a new situation: John was studying the plate tectonics of earth. He specifically selected two locations, location A and location B. He noticed that location A had lot of plate tectonics activities, but location B didn't have much of that. He wondered how that would make difference in those locations' characteristics.  Answer this question please: Would location B have less or more volcanoes than location A?

A: less


Problem: I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  Now, I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Answer this question please: Would Germany's government revenue increase or decrease as a result of their tax policy?

A: increase


Problem: I can use this background: Klinefelter's syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more extra copies of the X chromosome in a male's cells. Extra genetic material from the X chromosome interferes with male sexual development, preventing the testicles from functioning normally and reducing the levels of testosterone. Triple X syndrome (trisomy X) results from an extra copy of the X chromosome in each of a female's cells. Females with trisomy X have a lower IQ than their siblings. Turner syndrome results when each of a female's cells has one normal X chromosome and the other sex chromosome is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes the characteristic features of the condition, including short stature and infertility.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers born three years apart were very different. Jim had no genetic abnormalities, while Danny had Klinefelter's syndrome.  Answer this question please: Which brother had interference from the extra copies of the X chromosome in his cells?

A: Danny


Problem: I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Now, I have a new situation: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.  Answer this question please: Which runner didn't have an increased heart rate?

In addition, consider how the adoption of technology has affected various age groups and socioeconomic classes. Finally, discuss the potential long-term effects of technology on the overall well-being and happiness of society.","(0.9063, 0.4226)",24.999328942043046,3,"To analyze the impact of modern technology on the daily routines and social interactions of individuals living in urban areas versus rural areas, we can use two different forms of data visualization: bar graphs and maps.

Bar graphs can help us compare the usage of technology among different age groups and socioeconomic classes. For example, we can create a bar graph that shows the percentage of individuals in urban areas who own a smartphone by age group, and another bar graph that shows the percentage of individuals in rural areas who own a smartphone by age group. This would help us identify any age-related gaps in technology adoption.

Maps can help us visualize the differences in technology usage between urban and rural areas. For example, we can create a map that shows the percentage of individuals in urban areas who own a smartphone by city, and another map that shows the percentage of individuals in rural areas who own a smartphone by county. This would help us identify any regional disparities in technology adoption.

Based on our analysis of technology usage among different age groups and socioeconomic classes, we can see that individuals in urban areas tend to have higher levels of technology adoption than those in rural areas. For example, according to the Pew Research Center, the percentage of individuals in urban areas who own a smartphone is 86%, while the percentage of individuals in rural areas who own a smartphone is only 76%.

We can also see that there are age-related gaps in technology adoption. For example, according to the same Pew Research Center report, the percentage of individuals aged 18-29 who own a smartphone is 95%, while the percentage of individuals aged 65 and older who own a smartphone is only 47%.

These findings suggest that modern technology has a significant impact on the daily routines and social interactions of individuals living in urban areas compared to rural areas. The adoption of technology has also created disparities among different age groups and socioeconomic classes.

In terms of the potential long-term effects of technology on the overall well-being and happiness of society, there are both positive and negative impacts to consider. On the one hand, technology has made it easier for individuals to connect with others, access information, and complete tasks more efficiently. On the other hand, technology has also been linked to increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.

Ultimately, the impact of technology on society will depend on how individuals choose to use it.

As they approached the elephant, they each touched a different part of the elephant's body: one touched the elephant's trunk, another touched the elephant's ear, another touched the elephant's side, another touched the elephant's tail, another touched the elephant's knee, and another touched the elephant's leg.

Each blind man then described what he had touched, and they realized that they had different opinions about what the elephant was like. The first blind man said, ""The elephant is like a large snake, for its trunk is long and smooth."" The second blind man said, ""No, the elephant is like a fan, for its ear is broad and flat."" The third blind man said, ""I disagree, the elephant is like a wall, for its side is hard and rough."" The fourth blind man said, ""I don't think so, the elephant is like a rope, for its tail is thin and pliable."" The fifth blind man said, ""I don't agree, the elephant is like a pillar, for its knee is round and stout."" The sixth blind man said, ""I don't think so, the elephant is like a tree, for its leg is strong and straight.""

They argued about what the elephant was like, but they couldn't agree on any one description.

Finally, they decided to ask a wise old man what the elephant was like. The old man said, ""Each of you is right, but you are only seeing a part of the elephant. The elephant is like all of these things, and none of them. The elephant is a complex creature, and you can't understand it by just touching one part of it.""

The blind men realized that they had been foolish to argue about what the elephant was like, and they decided to work together to understand the elephant as a whole. They touched different parts of the elephant's body, and they listened to each other's descriptions. Slowly but surely, they began to see that the elephant was a magnificent creature, and they were grateful for the opportunity to experience it.

From that day on, the blind men and the elephant became friends. They would often spend time together, and the blind men would tell stories about their experiences with the elephant.

On the other hand, a machine learning model is a type of AI model that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

The main difference between an AI model and a machine learning model is that an AI model can perform tasks that are beyond the scope of machine learning. For example, an AI model can understand natural language, recognize faces, and mimic human-like behavior, while a machine learning model can only learn from data and make predictions based on that data.

There are also significant differences in the decision-making processes of each model. An AI model can make decisions based on a complex set of rules and algorithms that are programmed into the system. These models are designed to be accurate and efficient, but they can also be rigid and inflexible. In contrast, a machine learning model makes decisions based on the patterns and relationships it detects in the data it is trained on. These models are more adaptable and can learn from new data, but they are also more vulnerable to errors and biases in the data.

The ethical implications of each model's decision-making processes are also important to consider. An AI model is typically designed by humans and can be programmed to prioritize certain outcomes over others. This can lead to issues of fairness and transparency, as well as concerns about the model's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions and needs. A machine learning model, on the other hand, is more adaptable and can learn from new data, but it is also more vulnerable to errors and biases in the data it is trained on. This can lead to issues of accuracy and fairness, as well as concerns about the model's ability to recognize and respond to diverse and marginalized populations.

How can we ensure that the notifications for back-in-stock items are personalized for each customer's preferences? Let's delve deeper into the various HTML and JavaScript strategies that can be employed to optimize inventory management and customer satisfaction on our website.","(0.9063, 0.4226)",24.999328942043046,1,"Sure! To implement a system that alerts the inventory manager when a certain item is consistently going out of stock, we can use an algorithm that tracks the inventory levels of the item over a certain period of time, say a week or a month. If the inventory level falls below a certain threshold, such as 5 or 10 items, the system can send an alert to the inventory manager. The threshold can be set to the minimum number of items the store wants to keep in stock.

To ensure that notifications for back-in-stock items are personalized for each customer's preferences, we can use the order history of each customer to determine which items they have purchased in the past. We can then use this information to send targeted notifications to customers when their preferred items are back in stock.

To optimize inventory management and customer satisfaction on our website, we can implement the following HTML and JavaScript strategies:

1. Use dynamic HTML to update the inventory levels in real-time: When a customer adds an item to their cart or checks its availability, we can use AJAX to update the inventory levels on the page without reloading the entire page. This ensures that the customer gets the most up-to-date information about the inventory levels.

2. Use JavaScript to implement a search function: We can use JavaScript to implement a search function that allows customers to search for items by name or category. This can help customers easily find the items they are looking for and make their shopping experience more convenient.

3. Use JavaScript to implement a wishlist function: We can use JavaScript to implement a wishlist function that allows customers to add items to a wishlist for future purchase.

Plot title: The Killer Inside Me Movie plot: Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford (Casey Affleck) is a pillar of the community in his small west Texas town, patient, dependable, and well-liked. Beneath his pleasant facade, however, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by Mike, his older step-brother. Mike pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty). One day on the job, Mike had a fatal accident. Lou believes that Conway planned the accident.At the prodding of Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer (Jay R. Ferguson). When Joyce objects to Lou's treatment of her and slaps him, he throws her on the bed and uses his belt buckle for a spanking until her buttocks are bruised and bleeding. Joyce enjoys pain, and she and Lou begin a passionate love affair.Joyce suggests that Lou would never leave town with her, but they devise a plot to extort $10,000 from the Conways. Sheriff Maples and Chester Conway ask Lou to oversee the payoff. Lou has another plan: He viciously beats Joyce, intending to kill her. When Elmer arrives, Lou shoots and kills him. He then plants the gun on Joyce, hoping to make the scene look like a murder/suicide. Joyce survives, however, and Conway announces his intention to see her executed for killing Elmer.Lou's reputation begins to falter: His longtime girlfriend, Amy (Kate Hudson), suspects he is cheating on her, and the county district attorney, Howard Hendricks (Simon Baker), suspects that Lou could be behind the murders. Lou is asked to join Sheriff Maples and Conway in taking Joyce to a hospital in Fort Worth where doctors can operate on her; Conway wants her alive so he can interrogate her as soon as possible.

82,"As a company owner handling sensitive customer data, you must ensure compliance with strict data protection regulations while building customer trust. In addition to combining passwords and biometric identification, you must now also adhere to a new regulation that requires all customer data to be encrypted using quantum cryptography. To achieve this, you plan to use a quantum key distribution protocol to distribute keys for encryption and decryption. The passwords will be randomly generated and changed daily, and customers will be required to enter both their password and a fingerprint or facial scan to access their account. To make it more challenging for hackers, you establish a rule that passwords must be entered in a specific sequence based on a daily generated order. Additionally, you decide to add an extra layer of protection by generating random questions that only customers would know the answer to, such as ""What street did you grow up on?"" or ""What is your favorite color?"".

Step 2: Implement a random password generator that generates a unique password for each customer every day. These passwords must be complex, long, and composed of a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must not be stored in plain text or in a way that can be easily decrypted.

Step 3: Incorporate biometric identification technology that allows customers to authenticate their identity through facial or fingerprint scans. This technology must be reliable and accurate, and should be integrated into the company's existing authentication system.

Step 4: Establish a rule that requires customers to enter their password in a specific sequence based on a daily generated order. This will make it more challenging for hackers to gain access to customer accounts by guessing passwords.

Step 5: Implement a question-based authentication system that requires customers to answer a random question before they can access their accounts. These questions must be personalized and unique to each customer, and must be designed to be difficult to guess.

Step 6: Ensure that all customer data is encrypted using quantum cryptography, which is the most secure method of encryption available. This encryption must be implemented at all stages of data transmission and storage, including during backup and recovery.

Step 7: Regularly test the security of the company's authentication and encryption systems to identify and address any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. This testing should include penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and other security assessments.

Step 8: Educate customers on the importance of data privacy and security, and provide them with resources and tools to help them protect their accounts and personal information. This education should include clear instructions on how to use the company's authentication and encryption systems, as well as tips on how to create strong passwords and avoid phishing scams.

Additionally, compare and contrast the effects of external factors such as temperature, pressure, and concentration on the stability and reactivity of both types of mixtures, and analyze how they affect the overall performance and efficiency of the systems they are employed in. Consider both theoretical and practical perspectives, and integrate relevant research and experimental findings to support your arguments.","(0.9397, 0.3420)",19.999328942043046,2,"A homogenous mixture is a material composed of a single chemical species or a uniform blend of two or more chemical species that are physically and chemically indistinguishable. In contrast, a heterogeneous mixture is a material composed of two or more chemical species that are physically distinguishable and exist in different phases or states of matter. The contrasting characteristics and behavior of these two types of mixtures are influenced by their molecular composition and physical properties.

Homogenous mixtures are characterized by a uniform composition and properties, such as density, viscosity, and melting point. Examples of homogenous mixtures include solutions, gases, and alloys. The unique features of homogenous mixtures are that they have uniform properties throughout their volume, and they can be formed by dissolving one or more substances in a solvent or by combining two or more substances in a chemical reaction. Homogenous mixtures are widely used in various scientific and industrial fields, such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. For instance, aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid are used in industries to produce steel and aluminum, while gases such as O2 and CO2 are used as propellants in the aerospace industry.

On the other hand, heterogeneous mixtures are characterized by distinct physical and chemical properties of their constituent components. Examples of heterogeneous mixtures include suspensions, colloids, and emulsions. These mixtures have unique features such as their ability to separate into their constituent components when subjected to external forces such as centrifugation or filtration. Heterogeneous mixtures have many applications in various fields of science and technology, such as medicine, agriculture, and environmental engineering. For instance, suspensions of antibiotics in water are used to treat bacterial infections, while colloids of metal oxides are used in catalysis and water purification.

The behavior of both types of mixtures is influenced by external factors such as temperature, pressure, and concentration. Homogenous mixtures tend to be more stable and reactive under normal conditions, while heterogeneous mixtures are more sensitive to external factors and may undergo phase separation or chemical reactions under certain conditions. For instance, the melting point of a homogenous mixture of water and salt is lower than that of pure water due to the dissolved salt molecules lowering the freezing point of the solution. In contrast, the melting point of a heterogeneous mixture of oil and water is higher than that of pure water due to the presence of oil molecules that increase the viscosity of the solution.

In conclusion, homogenous and heterogeneous mixtures differ in their molecular composition and physical properties, leading to contrasting characteristics and behavior. Both types of mixtures have unique features and functions and are widely used in various scientific and industrial fields. Their behavior is influenced by external factors such as temperature, pressure, and concentration, and their stability and reactivity can be affected by these factors.

In a move that will surprise even the most devoted Apple fans, the tech giant has collaborated with the U.S. government to create a revolutionary new product: the Apple Monocle.

Designed specifically to make Joe Biden look smart, the Apple Monocle is a small, discreet device that attaches to the bridge of the nose and delivers a constant stream of vital information directly into the wearer's brain.

The device is powered by Apple's latest neural processing chip, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret vast amounts of data in real-time. This means that Biden can receive instantaneous updates on everything from world events to his own personal schedule, all without ever having to look away from the camera.

""We believe that the Apple Monocle represents a major breakthrough in the field of cognitive augmentation,"" said a spokesperson for Apple. ""By giving Joe Biden access to the most up-to-date information and analysis, we hope to help him make more informed decisions and better understand the complexities of the issues facing our country.""

But the Apple Monocle isn't just a technical marvel - it also has the potential to revolutionize politics. With its vast database of information and its ability to process that information in real-time, the Monocle could give Biden a significant advantage over his political rivals.

Of course, there are some who are skeptical of the Monocle's potential. Critics have argued that it could lead to a ""cognitive echo chamber"" in which Biden becomes increasingly isolated from the perspectives of others.

But for now, the Apple Monocle seems to be a hit. In a recent interview with Kamala Harris, the Vice President claimed that Biden is now almost deserving of the office.

""I have to say, since he started wearing the Monocle, Joe's been doing pretty well,"" Harris said with a smile. ""He's been able to keep up with the more complex issues, and he has a newfound confidence that I think is really impressive.""

Only time will tell if the Apple Monocle will truly live up to its promise.

Narrator: Hey there, it's me, MatPat! And today, we're going to explore the complex relationship between two of the most iconic characters in video game history: Miles Edgeworth and Phoenix Wright. But before we dive into the game theory behind their relationship, let's take a step back and look at some key moments in their interactions.

(Cut to a scene from Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations)

Narrator: In this scene, we see Phoenix and Edgeworth locked in a heated argument. They're both fiercely passionate about their work, and their clashing personalities make for some epic showdowns.

(Cut to another scene from Ace Attorney)

Narrator: But it's not just their professional rivalry that's interesting. There are also hints of a deeper connection between the two. Take this scene from Ace Attorney: Trials and Tribulations, for example.

(Cut to a scene where Edgeworth is seen blushing after Phoenix gives him a compliment)

Narrator: In this moment, we see Edgeworth blushing after Phoenix gives him a compliment. It's a small detail, but it hints at something deeper between the two.

(Cut to a scene from Ace Attorney)

Narrator: And then there's this moment, where we see Phoenix and Edgeworth working together to solve a case. They're both incredibly skilled lawyers, and their combined efforts make them an unstoppable force.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat)

Narrator: So, what does all of this mean? Well, it's clear that there's a lot of tension and attraction between Phoenix and Edgeworth. But does that mean they're in love? Let's explore some game theory to find out.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a whiteboard)

Narrator: Alright, let's start by considering the payoffs of different outcomes. If Phoenix and Edgeworth are in love, the payoff would be high, as they'd have a deep emotional connection. However, if they're not in love, the payoff would be lower, as they'd have to rely on their professional relationship alone.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a chart)

Narrator: Let's plot out the different payoffs on this chart. On the x-axis, we'll have the payoff for being in love, and on the y-axis, we'll have the payoff for not being in love.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a marker)

Narrator: Now, let's draw a line on the chart that represents the point where the payoffs are equal.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a calculator)

Narrator: If we calculate the slope of this line, we can determine the Nash equilibrium, or the point at which both parties are maximizing their payoffs.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a whiteboard)

Narrator: And it turns out that the Nash equilibrium for Phoenix and Edgeworth is not being in love. The payoffs for being in love are too high for either party, so it's not worth the risk.

(Cut to a shot of MatPat with a chart)

Narrator: So, what does this all mean for Phoenix and Edgeworth? Well, it seems that they're not in love. But that doesn't mean they don't have a deep emotional connection. It's clear that they have a strong mutual respect and admiration for each other, and that's what makes their professional relationship so powerful.

(Cut to a shot of Miles Edgeworth)

Narrator: In the end, it's up to you to decide whether or not you think Phoenix and Edgeworth are in love. But one thing is certain: their relationship is one of the most fascinating and complex in all of video game history.

Introduction:
Sarah is the owner of 10,000,000 square feet of commercial office spaces that she manages. She has been in business for over 20 years and has always relied on traditional surveying methods to keep track of her buildings' layouts, floor plans, and dimensions. However, with the advancement of technology, Sarah had heard of IPX, a web-based platform that mobilizes 3D scanning services to create accurate building data, floor plans, and saves the company money compared to traditional surveying expenses.

Problem:
Sarah's company had been facing a problem with the traditional surveying methods as they were time-consuming, expensive, and not always accurate. The process involved hiring a team of surveyors who would come in and take measurements of the building's dimensions, which would then be recorded in a manual survey. This process was not only time-consuming but also expensive as it required the hiring of a team of surveyors, and there was always the possibility of errors.

Solution:
Sarah decided to try IPX's platform to solve her company's problem with the traditional surveying methods. The platform allowed her to leverage 3D scanning services to create accurate building data, floor plans, and save her company money compared to traditional surveying expenses. The process involved IPX's team of expert technicians who would come in and perform a 3D scan of the building, which would then be processed and analyzed using advanced software to create accurate floor plans and building data.

Results:
IPX's platform proved to be a game-changer for Sarah's company. The platform provided accurate building data and floor plans, which allowed Sarah and her team to make informed decisions about the layouts and dimensions of her buildings, which ultimately saves her company money by reducing the need for expensive renovations and retrofits. Additionally, IPX's platform was cost-effective as it eliminated the need for a team of surveyors, which significantly reduced the company's expenses.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Sarah's company is now able to leverage IPX's platform to create accurate building data, floor plans, and save the company money compared to traditional surveying expenses. The platform has proven to be effective in providing accurate building data, which allows Sarah and her team to make informed decisions about the layouts and dimensions of her buildings.
